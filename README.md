# 🛠️ Product & Design Prompt Engineering Library

A specialized, public collection of tested and high-value prompts designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate **product development, software engineering, and UX/UI design workflows**.

Whether you're defining a feature, crafting user stories, or generating design copy, these prompts will help you integrate LLMs effectively into your product lifecycle.

## 🌟 Why Use These Prompts?

* **Product-Centric:** Prompts are engineered specifically for the language and structure needed in software development and product management.
* **Workflow Integration:** Designed to slot directly into common stages like requirement gathering, design iteration, and testing.
* **Tested Clarity:** Each prompt uses clear constraints, defined roles, and specific output formats (like tables or Jira-ready formats).

## 📁 Prompt Categories

| Category | Description | Example Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **💡 Product Strategy & Discovery** | Prompts for defining MVPs, analyzing competition, generating user personas, and drafting product requirement documents (PRDs). | Drafting a lean canvas, defining success metrics (OKRs/KPIs). |
| **💻 Software & Engineering** | Prompts for generating pseudo-code, writing detailed API specifications, creating database schemas, and generating technical documentation. | Defining REST endpoints, explaining complex architecture patterns. |
| **🎨 UX/UI Design & Content** | Prompts for defining user flows, generating effective microcopy, creating A/B test variations, and summarizing user research findings. | Writing button labels, crafting error messages, generating wireframe content. |
| **📈 Agile & Project Management** | Prompts for structuring Jira tickets, estimating complexity, generating detailed user stories (with acceptance criteria), and running sprint retrospectives. | Writing user stories in Gherkin syntax, summarizing daily stand-ups. |

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Browse:** Navigate to the folder that matches your current task (e.g., `ux-ui-design`).
2.  **Select:** Open the prompt file (e.g., `error-message-generator.md`).
3.  **Copy & Paste:** Copy the full prompt into your preferred LLM.
4.  **Customize:** **Crucially, replace all bracketed placeholders** (e.g., `[FEATURE_NAME]`, `[USER_GOAL]`) with your project-specific details.
5.  **Analyze:** Review the LLM's output and iterate by providing feedback within the same thread.

> **Tip:** For best results in product engineering, always give the LLM a specific **role** (e.g., "You are a Senior SaaS Product Manager...") and define the **target audience** of the final output
